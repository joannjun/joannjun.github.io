This project explores how access to mental health professionals affects community well-being. It analyzes the relationship between provider availability and poor mental health days using quasi-Poisson regression and machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict outcomes and identify the most significant contributing factors.
