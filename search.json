I love solving problems through data and bringing stories to life with numbers. I’m passionate about transforming raw data into clear insights that help people make better decisions, and I’m eager to apply these skills in data analyst and data scientist roles.\nWhen I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me baking something new or hiking a local trail."
