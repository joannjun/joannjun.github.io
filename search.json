    "text": "This project investigates differences in maternal health across states, focusing on factors such as body mass index (BMI) and prenatal care. We explored whether certain states have higher BMI and how the number of prenatal care visits relates to maternal health risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and tobacco use. The analysis includes cluster analysis using PCA, visualizations with choropleth maps, and comparisons using boxplots to highlight regional disparities."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project explores how access to mental health professionals affects community well-being. It analyzes the relationship between provider availability and poor mental health days using quasi-Poisson regression and machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict outcomes and identify the most significant contributing factors."
